# Work It Out!

A Gym Tracking application built in Flutter. For my **personal** use.

Planning on a client-server model. Do I need to do that? IDK. Maybe a system with backup to Google Drive.

### Planned Features

- Workout Tracking
    - Workout Type (Timed/Untimed)
    - Repitions
    - Details text box
- Schedule creation
    - Select workouts for daily workout
    - Workout reminders
- Backup and restore the database
